4. Is the world-wide web a category in any sense? Are links morphisms?
======================================================================

If you think of links as morphisms and pages as objects, then one first
approximation the web is a category.

5. Is Facebook a category, with people as objects and friendships as morphisms?
===============================================================================

We think not. You can't always reach your friends' friends.

6. When is a directed graph a category?
=======================================

It needs cycles to return to self (identity). Reflexive!

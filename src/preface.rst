I was overwhelmed by the positive response to my previous post, the
`Preface to Category Theory for
Programmers <https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/>`__.
At the same time, it scared the heck out of me because I realized
what high expectations people were placing in me. I’m afraid that no
matter what I’ll write, a lot of readers will be disappointed. Some
readers would like the book to be more practical, others more
abstract. Some hate C++ and would like all examples in Haskell,
others hate Haskell and demand examples in Java. And I know that the
pace of exposition will be too slow for some and too fast for
others. This will not be the perfect book. It will be a compromise.
All I can hope is that I’ll be able to share some of my aha! moments
with my readers. Let’s start with the basics.
